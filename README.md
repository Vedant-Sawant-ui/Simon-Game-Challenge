🎮 Simon Game Challenge
A fun and interactive memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery — inspired by Angela Yu’s Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.
This project is a small yet impactful part of my web development learning journey.

📌 About the Game
The Simon Game is a classic pattern-matching game where the system generates a sequence of colors and sounds, and the player must repeat the exact sequence.
With each correct round, the sequence becomes longer, increasing the difficulty level.
This project helped me understand:
DOM manipulation
jQuery event handling
Sounds & animations in JS
Game logic flow and pattern generation
Working with arrays, timeouts, and user interactions
🚀 Features
🎨 Four color-based interactive buttons
🧠 Automatic pattern generation
👆 User click detection
🔊 Sound effects for each button
💥 “Game Over” animation & restart option
📈 Level-based progression
🧩 How to Play
Press any key to start the game.
Watch the sequence—colors blink and play sounds.
Repeat the exact sequence by clicking the buttons.
With every successful round, the game generates a new, longer sequence.
Make a mistake ➝ “Game Over” message appears ➝ press any key to restart.
